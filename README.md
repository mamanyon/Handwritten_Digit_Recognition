# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition
we are going to use the MNIST dataset for the implementation of a handwritten digit recognition app. To implement this we will use a special type of deep neural network called Convolutional Neural Networks. In the end, we will also build a Graphical user interface(GUI) where you can directly draw the digit and recognize it straight away.

What is Handwritten Digit Recognition? Handwritten digit recognition is the process to provide the ability to machines to recognize human handwritten digits. It is not an easy task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect, vary from person-to-person, and can be made with many different flavors.
